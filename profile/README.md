We are creating opportunities for meaningful purpose and human connection, through the power of business and athletics.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Development Philosophy
As an engineer at Maet, **we strive to create elegant features for our fellow developers and our users**. We have created the following values that help us in our purpose to build valuable developer tools and delightful user experiences.

### ‚úåÔ∏è **Developer Values**
For our community of developers to create tools that they love to use and get excited about sharing with others.
1. **Modularity:** When we play Legos, having many well-defined pieces is much more valuable (and fun) than a completed static project. We want to be able to put together great tools, allowing us the space for flexibility and creativity. Examples include our implementation of [form-input](https://github.com/maetio/template/blob/main/src/screens/Login.tsx) component with [built-in form validation](https://github.com/maetio/template/blob/main/src/components/user-input/form-input.tsx).
2. **Communication of Knowledge:** As a talented developer at Maet, one of your top duties is effectively communicating your knowledge to our developer community, strengthening the experience of our whole team. Therefore, leave a paper trail of your methods to help transfer your knowledge to others, as we did in our [firebase configuration](https://github.com/maetio/template/blob/main/src/firebase/firebase-config.ts) and [redux hooks declarations](https://github.com/maetio/template/blob/main/src/hooks/useful-ducks.ts).
3. **Responsive and Lightweight:** Write code that automatically adapts to changes, like we did by choosing responsive sizing values or by [automatically generating dark and light themes](https://github.com/maetio/template/blob/main/src/constants/theme.ts). Additionally, only include libraries and files that are strictly necessary while avoiding copying and pasting the same code.

### üí° **Design Values**
Create an experience for the user that empathetically caters to their needs. There are many [design heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) to consider, but we list some of our most important ones here.
1. **Simplicity:** Offer users only options that are needed and do not overwhelm them with too many bright colors or complex functionality. Allow them the space to make easy, small decisions while generating a response to their needs. An example of this is the decision on the authentication flow to not ask the user whether they want to login in or sign-up, but automatically generating the next screen based on their email input.
2. **Agency:** Give the user the power to navigate the experience effectively, while also allowing them to go back and correct their mistakes when necessary. An example of this can be seen by confirming when to exit certain actions.
3. **Effort-Awareness:** Understand that the user does not want to fill out long forms or navigate many clicks to do a simple task. Give them smaller, digestable steps, being aware of their capacity for effort. An example of this is allowing the user to generate a guest account to temporarily experience the app so they do not have to initially commit to a long sign-up process.
4. **Feedback:** Illustrate to the user that their action occurred in some way, so that they can feel the response and not be lost in confusion/questioning if their response went through. An example of this would be generating alerts for their actions.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
